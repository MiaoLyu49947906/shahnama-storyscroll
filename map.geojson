    "description":"In this image, there are three men on the plain, and the Jihun river surrounds them. The man who wears in red is Gurwi, he is cutting the man’s neck who wears in green. His name is Siyavush. Then a soldier-like man villain Garsiwaz uses a golden basin to take Siyavush’s blood. This picture’s background is about the second part of the Epic of Siyavush.\n\nSiyavush, who is a major figure in Ferdowsi's epic, the Shahnameh, is a young man well-versed in the arts of war. He has a good reputation but is framed by his stepmother. Hence Siavash finds no alternative but to go into self-imposed exile in the mythical land of Turan, and seek shelter under the rule of Afrasiab, the tyrannical arch-enemy of the Iranian Shah. However, Afrasiab is cruel and he is also jealous of Siyavush’s reputation. After helping his wife escape, Siyavush is dragged before Afrasiab, who orders his execution by beheading. The hot-headed Afrasiab ignores others’ warnings and executes Siyavush. As Siyavush's blood reaches the ground, a plant grows upon the same spot and is later named 'Khune Asyavushan,' or the 'blood of Siyavush.' Siavash is the symbol of innocence in Iranian literature. The defense of his own chastity, self-imposed exile, constancy in love for his wife, and ultimate execution at the hands of his adopted host have become intertwined with Iranian mythology and literature over the past millennia. In Iranian mythology, his name is also linked with the growth of plants."},

    "description":"Here the ringleader Garsiwaz has ordered Gurwi to murder Siyavush.Garsiwaz glanced at Gurwi; then the villain turns round and goes up to Siyawush, showing no observance and humanity. He grasps the prince's beard with his hand, to drag him through the dust.\n\nGurwi is in red, under the red coat, he is lined with orange clothes. He wears a hat with two points, and the top of this hat is arched. Then he receives a blue-steel dagger from Garsiwaz for the bloody deed.\n\nGurwi drags Siyavush out into the plain by his hair afoot and does not behead him until they come to where the marker has stood.\n\nWhen he tries to kill Siyavush, Gurwi seizes Siyavush’s hair and rides on his back. Villain Gurwi’s eyebrows are furrowed and his mouth slightly opens in a fierce expression. He turns up the prince’s face as a‘twere a sheep’s’, cuts off the sliver Cypross’ head, and allows his blood to run into a bowl.\n\nThen Gurwi takes up the bowl and empties it where he has been commanded. From that blood presently there sprang a plant, which name is 'blood of Siyavush.'\n\nWhen the Sun had left the Cypress-stem, the prince's head had fallen asleep."},

    "description":"In this picture, the soldier-like man is the leader of Gurwi, Garsiwaz. He wears a semicircular hat and his face with a full beard. There is a mask under his hat to protect his face and neck, and the parts of his body are under the protection of this outfit. His skin is whiter than Siyavush and Gurwi.\n\nHe wears a fresh color robe like Gurwi, a yellow robe, and under the robe, he is in dark blue. There are two wrist guards on his arms to protect his wrists. Around his waist, Garsiwaz has a quiver hung which is full of arrows. From his outfit, it can be concluded that he is the minister and serves the King. The order of killing Siyavush is actually from their King, Afrasiab.\n\nWhen Gurwi is killing Siyavush, Garsiwaz is on his knees, holding up with both hands a golden basin for taking up Siyavush’s blood. The expression on his face is cold and cruel.Garsiwaz seems to feel nothing about Siyavush’s death, and he is very indifferent. After killing Siyavush, he commands Gurwi to empty the basin and pour the blood on the plain, which makes the plant “blood of Siyavush” grows up."},

    "description":"In this picture, the most important figure is prince Siyavush, the victim of this slaying.\n\nHe has to leave his own country because his stepmother frames him of harassment, and his father does not trust him.\n\nSiyavush has to seek shelter under the rule of Afrasiab, the tyrannical arch-enemy of the Iranian Shah. However, Afrasiab is also jealous his reputation and plans to kill him.\n\nSiyavush helps his wife run away from this country and go to a safe place, but he is caught by two villains who ordered by king Afrasiab. They grab his hair and beard, and drag him to a marked plain for murdering him.\n\nPrince Siyavush also has long hair and a beard. He wears a green robe and blue boots. Among the three men in this picture, his face is the plainest and grayest. He is pinned to the plain by Gurwi, who is riding on his back, so Siyavush is forced to tilt his head up.Gurwi uses a dagger to slit his throat. The expression on Siyavush’s face is very sad. Then the blood runs from his neck into the golden basin.\n\nBefore he died, the prince keeps shouting and praying. He is innocent until his last breath."},

    "description":"Gurwi drags Siyavush’s beard and hair, from the town to the countryside and stops at the spot where is marked.\n\nIn this picture, at the top left, there is a black dot on the plain. It is the mark which means here is the doomed place where the king and villains prepare for Siyavush’s death.Siavash's sudden rise to favor at the Turanian court causes much jealousy amongst certain of the knights and dignitaries, Garsivaz, foremost among the disgruntled few, send secret messages to Afrasiab, proclaiming Siavash 'a traitor,' and the king believes him cause he is also jealous of Siyavush.\n\nIt can be seen from here that the king has been planning to murder the prince for a very long time. This murderer is well-prepared.\n\nThere is some grass on this plain, hence, after Siyavush died, when his blood reaches the ground, a plant grows upon the same spot. It is named 'Khune Asyavushan,' or the 'blood of Siyavush.'\n\nThis plant represents the spirit of Siyavush, and his figure also becomes the representation of innocent human beings. This line in the epic ties the story to the early links between the name 'Siavash,' and his role as the spirit of vegetative growth."},

    "description":"The river surrounding these men is also a part of this picture, which is connected with the plain. It is blue, clear, and gentle. The quiet river is an extreme contrast with the thing that is happening on the plain.\n\nThe quiet water contrasts sharply with the fierce murder which is taking place on the plain; so I think the clear river may also be a metaphor for the Prince's innocence and his tragedy.\n\nWhether in his own country, Siyavush has to flee from his father because he is framed by his stepmother——who loves him but can not get him; and after, he has come to a new country and marry with the princess, but also is framed again, because of the jealous of Garsivaz, who writes a secret letter to the king, accusing him of being a traitor, and result in that the prince is eventually killed.\n\nSiyavush always suffers from a lot of unfair treatment, but he is still pure and innocent. When he is dragged onto the plain and knows his doom, Pilsam is crying for him, but Siyavush keeps praying to god before he dies. His tragedies are always as silent as the river in the background. The plant which grows because of his blood also proves this point."},

    "description":"This picture describes a scene that the minister Garsiwaz, under the order of the king,  Afrasiab, with Gurwi, these two villains, plan to slay Prince Siyavush on the plain. There are three main figures in the scene, Garsiwaz, Gurwi, and Siyavush. The spot they are in is a wasteland surrounded by a gentle river. In the upper left of this picture, there is a black dot indicating that this place is doom marked spot. Gurwi grabs Siyavush by his hair and beard and forces him to lift his head so that he can slit Siyavush's throat with a dagger. He rides on top of Siyavush’s back. Gurwi dresses simply, but with a cruel look on his face. Meanwhile, Garsiwaz knees on the ground before Siyavush. He dresses in a soldier's uniform while holding a golden basin in his hands. The blood overflows from Siyavush's neck is pouring into the basin. Between Garsiwaz and Gurwi, Siyavush is pinned to the ground by Gurwi, his face is ashen and pained because blood is spurting from his neck. Before he died, he keeps praying. The execution of Siyavush is a frightening scene because these killers are very cruel and indifferent."},
