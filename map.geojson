    "description":"In this image, there are three men on the plain, and the Jihun river surrounds them. The man who wears in red is Gurwi, he is cutting the man’s neck who wears in green. His name is Siyavush. Then a soldier-like man villain Garsiwaz uses a golden basin to take Siyavush’s blood. This picture’s background is about the second part of the Epic of Siyavush.\n\nSiyavush, who is a major figure in Ferdowsi's epic, the Shahnameh, is a young man well-versed in the arts of war. He has a good reputation but is framed by his stepmother. Hence Siavash finds no alternative but to go into self-imposed exile in the mythical land of Turan, and seek shelter under the rule of Afrasiab, the tyrannical arch-enemy of the Iranian Shah. However, Afrasiab is cruel and he is also jealous of Siyavush’s reputation. After helping his wife escape, Siyavush is dragged before Afrasiab, who orders his execution by beheading. The hot-headed Afrasiab ignores others’ warnings and executes Siyavush. As Siyavush's blood reaches the ground, a plant grows upon the same spot and is later named 'Khune Asyavushan,' or the 'blood of Siyavush.' Siavash is the symbol of innocence in Iranian literature. The defense of his own chastity, self-imposed exile, constancy in love for his wife, and ultimate execution at the hands of his adopted host have become intertwined with Iranian mythology and literature over the past millennia. In Iranian mythology, his name is also linked with the growth of plants."},

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
